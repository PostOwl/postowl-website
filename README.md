# PostOwl website

This is the source for the PostOwl website at https://www.postowl.com

The site is deployed to Cloudflare Pages.

## Credits

We are using the excellent [Doks theme](https://getdoks.org/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) by Henk Verlind.

## Development

The site was started in July 2023 and we're using the pre-release of the new version of Doks: [v1.0.0-rc.2](https://github.com/h-enk/doks/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.2)

The only dev requirements are Git and NodeJS >= 18.16.0

The initial site was bootstrapped with `npm create hyas@latest -- --template doks`

The commits in this repo show the customisations we've made since then.

To run locally, clone this repo, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`. Follow the [Doks theme](https://getdoks.org/) for more details on available commands etc.

The theme uses [Bootstrap 5.3](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2023/05/30/bootstrap-5-3-0/) which has some great new features including dark mode and custom color support.
