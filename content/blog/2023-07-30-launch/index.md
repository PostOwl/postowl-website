Today we're excited to release PostOwl to the world.

Release 0.1.0 is [available from GitHub](https://github.com/PostOwl/postowl/) as a technical preview for people who are comfortable hosting it themselves. We provide instructions for doing this in the README.

The application is stable for general use, but please don't trust important data to it yet without making backups and copies of your SQLite database.

Please [share any issues you find](https://github.com/PostOwl/postowl/issues) and [let us know your ideas for future development](https://github.com/PostOwl/postowl/discussions/categories/ideas)!

Thanks for trying PostOwl!
