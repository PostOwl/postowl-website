We've made a new release that significantly alters the deployment mechanism for fly.io. The lays the groundwork for making things easier in the future.

If you have an existing PostOwl deployment and want to keep the data, there's a bit of work involved. All the details you need are in the [release notes and GitHub discussion](https://github.com/PostOwl/postowl/discussions/28).

Thanks for trying PostOwl!
