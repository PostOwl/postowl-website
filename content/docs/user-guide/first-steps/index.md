## 1. Get your PostOwl website

To use PostOwl you'll need your own website running the PostOwl software.

PostOwl is currently in 'technical preview' and you'll need some technical knowledge to [deploy your site](/docs/administration-guide/deploy/) and make it live on the web.

Soon there will be a hosted version that will make it easy for everyone to have their own PostOwl. [Sign up for the newsletter](/newsletter) to hear when it's ready.

## 2. Basic usage

PostOwl is easy to use (at least we hope it is)!

We'll be adding more detailed documentation on all its features very soon. For now, the fastest way to see how to use it is to [watch the video on the home page](/).

If you're not able to watch the video, you should still be able to get started by trying the app and playing around. All the actions you can take once signed in are in the menu at the top right of the screen.
