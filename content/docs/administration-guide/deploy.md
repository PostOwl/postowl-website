PostOwl is a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) application inspired by [editable.website](https://editable.website) using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for the database. It's currently optimised for SvelteKit's [adapter-node](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-node) to enable [deployment to Fly.io](#deployment-to-flyio).

## More deployment options coming soon!

We'll be adding instructions for deploying to other hosts soon. If you have success deploying to other platforms, please [let us know](https://github.com/PostOwl/postowl/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) or submit a PR documenting how you did it.

## Sending email in production

PostOwl uses [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) to send email notifications when you send letters to friends.

The application will run without a real SMTP server configured so **you can enter dummy data for the SMTP settings when deploying if you don't need to send emails**.

If you'd like to send emails but don't have an SMTP server to use, we recommend [mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/). Their free tier will cover usage for a personal PostOwl site. You'll need to own a domain name to get set up with mailgun. Follow their documentation to activate your domain for email sending. Then generate an SMTP password from their admin interface (click 'Reset password' under Sending > Domain Settings > SMTP credentials to get a password for a new domain).

## Deployment to fly.io

**PostOwl runs for free on [fly.io](https://fly.io/)** which is one of the reasons we're recommending their platform for the first release. If you follow the steps here you should have a live site in about 15 minutes.

The [PostOwl repository](https://github.com/PostOwl/postowl) contains the files you need to deploy your PostOwl site to fly.io.

1. Create an account with [fly.io](https://fly.io/).
   1. Add your credit card to Fly. PostOwl runs well on Fly's free tier but they [require an active, valid credit / bank card](https://fly.io/docs/about/credit-cards/) to prevent abuse. Unless you have a very busy site, hosting will be free.
1. [Install `flyctl`](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) and sign in with `fly auth login`
1. Clone this repo to a directory on your computer: `git clone https://github.com/PostOwl/postowl.git`
1. Enter the directory you cloned the repo to: `cd postowl`
1. Run `fly apps create` and respond to the prompts:
   1. Choose a name for your app (e.g. `yourapp`- app names need to be unique across all of fly.io) or hit enter to let Fly auto generate a name
   1. Choose a Fly organization to deploy to if prompted
1. Rename `fly.toml.example` to `fly.toml` and edit the lines between 'BEGIN EDITS' and 'END EDITS' - make sure to set the app name to the name you chose in the previous step
1. Edit the values in the 'fly deploy' command below and then run it in your terminal
   1. Don't change the value of `DB_PATH`
   1. Make sure to replace `yourapp` with the name you chose when creating the application above
   1. Edit all remaining values with `your` in them
   1. For the SMTP details, see the section above [Sending email in production](#sending-email-in-production). You don't need to use real values to try the app

```
fly deploy \
    --build-secret DB_PATH="./data/db.sqlite3" \
    --build-secret ORIGIN="https://yourapp.fly.dev" \
    --build-secret ADMIN_NAME="Your Name" \
    --build-secret ADMIN_EMAIL="you@your.domain" \
    --build-secret ADMIN_PASSWORD="your-super-secret-admin-password" \
    --build-secret SMTP_SERVER="your.smtp.server" \
    --build-secret SMTP_PORT="465" \
    --build-secret SMTP_USERNAME="postmaster@your.smtp.server" \
    --build-secret SMTP_PASSWORD="your-super-secret-smtp-password"
```
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  ‚ö†Ô∏è ATTENTION: On each subsequent deploy you need to apply the previous command again, including all the --build-secret entries. We are looking for ways to improve this.  We had situations where the deploy got stuck, but re-running the command fixed it.
</div>

Fly will let you know when the app is deployed. Visit the URL shown in your terminal and sign in with the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you set above.

Have fun creating letters! ü¶â

## Connect a domain to your Fly.io app

You can serve your PostOwl from a domain or subdomain you own.

- Run `fly ips list -a myapp` to get the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- Head over to your DNS provider and add A and AAAA records for myapp.com with the IPv4 and IPv6 values.
- Run `fly certs create -a myapp myapp.com`
- Run `fly certs show -a myapp myapp.com` to watch your certificates being issued.

More details and considerations for subdomains in the [fly docs](https://fly.io/docs/app-guides/custom-domains-with-fly/)
